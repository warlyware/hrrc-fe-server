            At HRRC, we envision a world where human rights are the cornerstone of a student’s education.
        </p>
        <p class="margin-top-0">
            As such, the HRRC is about empowering instructors from all fields and disciplines to incorporate human

            Mission
        </h2>
        <p class="margin-top-0">
            HRRC accomplishes its goals by drafting and disseminating human rights lesson plans and supplementary
            materials that both graduate and undergraduate university instructors can weave into lectures on a wide
            range of subjects, including social studies, world history, politics, international relations,
            sociology, courses on business management, and even mathematics.
        </p>
        <p class="margin-top-0">
            HRRC also publishes materials dedicated to the most recent trends in human rights and gives students and instructors alike a platform for discourse and study by submitting and utilizing human rights related articles and papers.

            David Rothenberg studied international human rights in graduate school at Florida State University where he and
            Daniel Swaisgood co-founded the Human Rights Awareness Center, a student organization focused on creating interest
            in human rights related events and activities on campus. After graduation, David taught two human rights courses for
            FSU’s Program in Humanities and worked at the Center for Global Engagement with various student exchange programs.
            He then moved to South Korea for five and a half years, teaching ESOL, writing ESL textbooks, and developing the
            English LanguageTest for the 2018 Winter Olympic volunteers. David is now the analytics manager for
            Literacy Partners, an NYC-based nonprofit that promotes multi-generational literacy and offers English Language
            and High School Equivalency classes. The Human Rights Realization Community is a project David started as a
            place where students and educators interested in human rights can openly express and discuss their opinions

            compiling lesson plans based on human rights textbooks and other literature before beginning our initial
            outreach to university departments and educators in an attempt to increase the number of human rights courses,
            certificates, and degree programs offered in the US.

            Daniel Swaisgood’s academic journey into the field of human rights and social development began during his
            undergraduate studies at Florida State University where, alongside David Rothenberg, he engaged
            introductory courses such as human rights literature and human rights film, and helped establish a
            student-run, human rights awareness group.  However, it was during his graduate studies where this
            journey really developed into a career pursuit.  During his Master’s studies, he not only assisted
            professors in their human rights-related interests by researching and editing, he also created, and
            spent two years instructing, an undergraduate course on human rights development in U.S. history.
            <br><br>
            Following his graduate studies, Daniel attended law school where he focused his studies on various
            manifestations of human rights law and international law.  After then working in the areas of immigration,
            criminal, and family law, Daniel eventually took a job with a local NGO where he was appointed to represent
            exploited and trafficked children in court.  In addition to representing exploited children, Daniel also
            represented the NGO at social outreach events and worked on monitoring and evaluating the NGOs volunteer
            training program.
            <br><br>
            At present, Daniel is living in Bangkok, Thailand where he consults on a variety of human rights
            and social development issues for civil service organizations, international social development
            NGOs, as well as the United Nations.
